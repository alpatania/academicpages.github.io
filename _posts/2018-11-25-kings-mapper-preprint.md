New work out, together with collaborators at King's College London, Imperial College London and ISI Foundation. We applied the Mapper algorithm to the AHBA (Allen Human Brain Atlas). Our results suggest that topological network descriptions can be a powerful tool to explore the relationships between genetic pathways and their association with brain function and its perturbation due to illness and/or pharmacological challenge.
