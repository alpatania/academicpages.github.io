I have always had trouble navigating the huge amount of new papers, pre-prints, and tweets that come out every day.
I always felt like I was the last one to know about other people's research until I went to a conference or stumbled 
upon it during the literature research for a new paper. I still haven't figured out twitter, but I did figure out how 
to have a list of new papers and pre-prints as they come out. It might not be the smartest way, but last year I coded a small script to compactify all the Google Scholar alerts I 
subscribe to.  

** How do the Google Scholar Alerts work? **  
Google Scholar is a freely accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines 
[[Wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar)]. Every researcher can have their own page with their verified indexed research in the systems and suggestion of
new research in their areas. I find it very useful when doing some literature review for new projects, or discovering other peoples' research. It is possible to sign-up for 
weekly email alering you of new papers indexed in the systems that are relevant to your research, somebody else's research, new papers by your favorite scientists or related 
to a certain keywords. Even though the Google Alerts can be very useful, receiving 10 emails a week about the same paper can be quite annoying, so I decided to do something about it.
