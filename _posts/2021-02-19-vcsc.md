<p>I am so excited to tell the world that I am an inaugural member of the <a href="https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/">Vermont Complex Systems Center</a> External Faculty. 
I am humbled to be part of this inspiring group of researchers that I have admired for so long! I mean seriously! Look at the company I have: <a href="https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/people/external-faculty/">VCSC External Faculty </a>. </br>
Some of them I have known for a while and others I have been adolizing from afar. They are all super-nice people and great scientists and I can't wait for the opportunity to spend some time talking science with them. The future is looking bright!<br>

And did you see their cute mascots?</br>
