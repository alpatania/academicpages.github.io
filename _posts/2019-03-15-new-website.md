I decided to revamp my website with something that was more easily manageble. Talking with collegues I decided to give Jekyll a try. Setting the site up is taking longer than I thought, but I am slowly getting there. Hopefully this winter break will be helpful. Stay tuned! 

**Update:** The website is now fully functional, some content is missing still (I'll try uploading my posters and slides online) but overall everything is up and running now.
