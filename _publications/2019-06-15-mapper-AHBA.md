Understanding how gene expression translates to and affects human behaviour is one of the ultimate aims of neuroscience. In this paper, we present a pipeline based on Mapper, a topological simplification tool, to produce and analyze genes co-expression data. We first validate the method by reproducing key results from the literature on the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and the correlations between resting-state fMRI and gene co-expression maps. We then analyze a dopamine-related gene-set and find that co-expression networks produced by Mapper returned a structure that matches the well-known anatomy of the dopaminergic pathway. Our results suggest that topological network descriptions can be a powerful tool to explore the relationships between genetic pathways and their association with brain function and its perturbation due to illness and/or pharmacological challenge.
