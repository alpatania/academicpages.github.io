excerpt: 'Code for reproducing results in the paper "Topological gene-expression networks recapitulate brain anatomy and function". <br> We present a pipeline based on the Mapper algorithm, a topological simplification tool, to produce and analyze genes co-expression data. <br> The code contains an implementation of the Mapper algorithm with 2 filters and to compute the agreement edge density matrices for the optimal parameters.'
