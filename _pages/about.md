An algebraic topologist by training, my main focus is to develop and apply new topological approaches to study complex systems. In particular, I work on applying these tools to biological networks.

I am currently a Research Scientist at [Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI)](http://iuni.iu.edu/) in Bloomington(IN). I work on mathematical modelling for brain networks in close collaboration with Olaf Sporns and his team.

As of March 2017 I am a member of the Advisory board of the [young researchers of the Complex Systems Society](http://yrcss.cssociety.org/). Together with the other members of the board, we have organized many initiatives aimed at students and young researchers. 

I obtained my Ph.D in Applied Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino with a dissertation titled: "Simplicial Data Analysis: theory, practice, and algorithms". During my PhD I worked at I.S.I. Foundation in Torino, where I was a part of the research group on "Mathematics and the foundation of complex systems".

Here are some of the projects I am focusing on right now:

- Simplicial Configuration Model: Random model for Simplicial Complexes, joint work with Jean-Gabriel Young @ Université Laval, Quebec City;
- Statistical properties of random graphs from an homological pont of view, joint work with Dr. Riccardo Jadanza and Prof. Francesco Vaccarino @ Politecnico di Torino;
- Studying Mathematical models of community structures in relation to simplicial complexes, joint work with Jean-Gabriel Young @ Université Laval, Quebec City;
- Topological gene-expression networks on brain, joint work with G.Petri, P. Expert, M. Veronese, P. Selvaggi @ King's College, London
- Creating a Python module for a high dimensional Mapper Algorithm.
- Topological Data Analysis on real data (rna transcriptomes, quantitative semantic data, brain networks from fMRI, EEG, DTI).
